## Security Considerations

⚠️ **Important Security Notes:**
- Never commit `.env` files or sensitive credentials to the repository
- Use strong, unique passwords for all services
- Regularly update dependencies to patch security vulnerabilities
- Use HTTPS in production
- Implement rate limiting for API endpoints
- Regularly backup your database
- Monitor system logs for suspicious activities

## Features

- User Authentication (Doctors and Patients)
- Appointment Management
- Medical Records Management
- File Upload Support
- Role-based Access Control
- Responsive Design

## Tech Stack

### Frontend
- React
- Material-UI
- React Router
- Context API for State Management

### Backend
- Node.js
- Express
- MongoDB

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- MongoDB (v4.4 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- Docker (optional)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/healthcare-management-system.git
cd healthcare-management-system
```

2. Create environment files:
```bash
# Copy example env files
cp .env.example auth-service/.env
cp .env.example appointments-service/.env
cp .env.example medical-records-service/.env
cp .env.example api-gateway/.env
cp .env.example frontend/.env

# Edit each .env file with your configuration
```

3. Install dependencies for each service:
```bash
# Frontend
cd frontend
npm install

# Auth Service
cd ../auth-service
npm install

# Appointment Service
cd ../appointments-service
npm install

# Medical Records Service
cd ../medical-records-service
npm install

# API Gateway
cd ../api-gateway
npm install
```

4. Start the services:

Using Docker:
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

Or without Docker:
```bash
# From the project root
./start.sh
```

## Development

### Code Style
- Use ESLint for code linting
- Follow the existing code style
- Write meaningful commit messages

### Testing
- Write unit tests for new features
- Run tests before committing
- Maintain test coverage above 80%

### Security Best Practices
- Never store sensitive data in code
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Implement proper input validation
- Use prepared statements for database queries
- Implement proper error handling
- Use secure headers
- Implement CORS properly

## Deployment

### Production Checklist
- [ ] Set up SSL/TLS certificates
- [ ] Configure proper CORS settings
- [ ] Set up proper logging
- [ ] Configure rate limiting
- [ ] Set up monitoring
